# My-ML-Library
A project on implementation of standard ML Algorithms from scratch using Numpy and Pandas libraries. It also contains the application of the ML algorithms using this library and comparison of accuracy between the library created and scikit-learn. This is an ongoing project of mine so new algorithm implementations will be frequently updated.

# Algorithms Implemented: 
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Multi-Layered Perceptron
* K-Means Clustering
* KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
* Decision Tree
