# Ml-AlgoithmsKit
Implementation of standard ML Algorithms from scratch using Numpy and Pandas libraries. New algorithm implementations will be frequently updated in the repo.

# Algorithms Implemented: 
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Multi-Layered Perceptron
* K-Means Clustering
* KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
* Decision Tree

## Installation: Building the Library using PyProject.toml file
Clone this directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sandeshkatakam/ML-AlgorithmsKit.git
```

Navigate to the cloned library dir and open the terminal from that path  
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
```
The above commands upgrades the build tools neccessary for building the .whl for the library

```bash
python3 -m build
```
You will recieve the following message from the terminal:  
```
Successfully built MLAlgorithmsKit-0.0.1.tar.gz and MLAlgorithmsKit-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
```
Once completed, will generate these .whl and .tar.gz files
```
dist/
├── MLAlgorithmsKit-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
└── MLAlgorithmsKit-0.0.1.tar.gz
```

Now the package is built and can be installed using `pip`.   
Follow this command to install the package:  
```bash
pip install MLAlgorithmsKit-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Usage:  

You can start using the Package and follow the below examples to get started:
